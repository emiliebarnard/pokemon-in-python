Don't forget to swap to gh-pages branch if editing the website!

## Using GitHub

### Branches

There are two *branches* for this project: `main` and `gh-pages`. `main` is where I've been throwing my testing Python code. This section won't actually be part of the final deliverable, but we can use it to save Python code that you work with if you'd like. `gh-pages` is the branch that actually is the website, our deliverable.

To see what branch you're currently looking at, look for the drop down arrow on the top left. If you want to work on the website, make sure you swap over to gh-pages.

### Contributing

There's a few different ways you can contribute to files on GitHub. I'll suggest the easiest possible for those who haven't used it before, but feel free to do whatever works for you or research alternatives. You can click on a file listed out in the folder structure to view it. **The bulk of the content needs to be added to index.md under the gh-pages branch.** So, for example, once you make sure you're on the gh-pages branch, click on the index.md file in the folder list. Look for the pencil button on the top left:

Click that to edit the file. To "save," scroll down and enter in some sort of "title" to explain the change you made. You can optionally add a longer description. Then, click *commit changes.* Don't worry about the second option to create a new branch - no need for that here.

### Warnings

GitHub is great, but when two people are working on the same file at the same time, weird things can happen. So, I **strongly recommend you send a quick message to the group on Discord if you are starting to work on a file, then send another one when you are done.** Ideally, we should try to *not* overlap the time we are working on the same file.

### Checking the Website

It will take up to a few minutes for GitHub to properly set up the website anytime you make an edit to a file in gh-pages. You can track the "build" progress by clicking on the *Actions* tab at the top. There will be a long list of workflows there, as it shows everything that was done when anyone saved a file. The most recent one is at the top, so watch that one. It should hopefully turn into a green checkmark. When it does, you can check the results on the website: https://emiliebarnard.github.io/pokemon-in-python/. You may need to check using a private/incognito window if your computer cached the website before to see the changes.
